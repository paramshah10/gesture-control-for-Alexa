# gesture-control-for-Alexa

Embedded machine learning model for gesture detection to control Alexa built using the SensorTile and Nucleo Board.

A video demonstrating the operation and the capability of my system should is shown here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzyRqPPfss&t=4s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IPzyRqPPfss&t=4s). 
<br/>The first half of the video shows the training and the second shows the testing of the model. Even though the laptop screen in the video is not clear, you can check that the system works correctly by counting the LED blinks, which indicate the motion detected.
